<h1>Reef Conditions and Interactions</h1>
  <h2>Key Terms in Marine Ecology</h2>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Ecosystem</strong> - Network of interactions between organisms</p>
  <p><strong>Habitat</strong> - Environment where organisms live</p>
  <p><strong>Community</strong> - All organisms co-existing within a habitat</p>
  <p><strong>Population</strong> - All members within a single species</p>
  <p><strong>Niche</strong> - A role within an ecosystem</p>
  <p><strong>Function</strong> - A benefit provided to the ecosystem</p>
  <p><strong>Service</strong> - A benefit provided to humans</p>
  <p><strong>Species Richness</strong> - The number of species in a habitat</p>
  <p><strong>Biodiversity</strong> - The variety of life within a habitat (encompassing species richness and population size of each species)</p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Pelagic</strong> - Associated with the open water</p>
  <p><strong>Benthic</strong> - Associated with the sea floor (the "benthos")</p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Plankton</strong> - Organisms that float and cannot swim against water movement</p>
  <p><strong>Nekton</strong> - Swimming organisms</p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Sessile</strong> - Stays in the same place </p>
  <p><strong>Motile</strong> - Freely moving</p>
  <h2>Factors Influencing Reef Conditions</h2>
<p>We can group factors into those that are <strong>abiotic</strong> (non-biological) and those that are <strong>biotic</strong> (biological). Abiotic factors include but are not limited to the following…</p>
<p><strong>Temperature</strong><br>
The optimum temperature for coral reefs is 23 to 29 degrees Celsius. If the temperature is too high or too low photosynthesis and other metabolic processes important for coral and other organisms are inhibited. Corals generally cannot tolerate temperatures below 18 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p><strong>Sunlight</strong><br>
Lots of sunlight is needed for maximum photosynthesis for corals and other organisms. Additionally, many reef organisms depend on vision to find food and other resources and to signal to one another. However, organisms in shallow waters may face the risk of stress caused by too much ultraviolet light from the sun.</p>
<p><strong>pH</strong><br>
pH (or ‘acidity’) is actually a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions. It is measured on a scale of 1-14 with 1 being highly acidic, 7 being neutral and 14 being highly alkaline. The ocean is slightly alkaline due to a presence of dissolved carbonate and bicarbonate. The optimum pH for coral reefs is 7.7 – 8.4.</p>
<p><strong>Sedimentation and Turbidity</strong><br>
‘Turbidity’ refers to the amount of suspended particles in the water column. This will mostly be in the form of stirred up sediment. River run-off, weather disturbance and land disturbance all tend to increase sedimentation. High sedimentation reduces sunlight, which affects the depth at which photosynthetic organisms can thrive. It can also smother the feeding appendages of corals and other organisms that rely on catching small bits of food from the water. Mangroves and seagrass beds are very important for locking in the sediment so that it stabilizes on the benthos and is not so easily swooshed about.</p>
<p><strong>Salinity</strong><br>
Salinity (aka ‘saltiness’) in the ocean is caused by rock erosion from the land, as well as hydrothermal and volcanic activity. The average ocean salinity is 35ppt (parts per thousand). Suitable salinity is important for optimum calcification rate of growing corals. Freshwater flooding can be a threat to salinity.</p>
<p><strong>Hydrodynamics</strong><br>
Here, we are referring to the forces that cause water movement around coral reefs.<ul>
<li>Waves – Important for inducing the mixing of nutrients. If waves are strong they can also cause mechanical damage to fragile organisms. Hence, areas of high wave action favour more endurable species, such as corals with flat growth forms, or soft corals and other flexible organisms.</li>
<li>Currents – Help the flow of nutrients. Often the areas of highest growth on the reef are areas most exposed to currents. They also have an effect on temperature distribution. Warm water may be carried from areas of high sun exposure, but upwellings may also bring up cold water from the deep. In areas of strong currents, swimming organisms may have to expend more energy on swimming against the current.</li>
<li>Tides – Tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon (and to some extent the sun). Tidal ranges (i.e. the distance between the shoreline at high tide and low tide) vary on different coast lines and in different parts of the world. The Caribbean has very small tidal ranges. In the Indo-Pacific, tidal ranges get much bigger. This means that reef organisms here need to adapt to these large fluctuations which in turn affect exposure to sunlight and other factors.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Reef characteristics differ at different parts of the reef. For example… 
<ul>
<li>In the shallows, fish are more likely to be small and abundant. At greater depths, they tend to be fewer in numbers but bigger in size.</li>
<li>Green algae will only be found in the shallow or (particularly well-lit) parts of the benthos because it absorbs red light and this does not penetrate water as far as other light waves. Beyond a certain depth, red and brown algae will dominate.</li>
</ul>
If you have a good understanding of the local organisms, you can look for clues about the conditions, depending on what’s growing where. For example…
<ul>
<li>A particularly high domination of foliose coral may indicate that the area receives lots of sediment, making it hard for other coral growth forms to compete.</li> 
</ul>
