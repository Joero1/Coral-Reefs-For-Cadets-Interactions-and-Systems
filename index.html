<h1>Conditions and Interactions</h1>
<br>
  
  <h2>Factors Influencing Reef Conditions</h2>
<p>We can group factors into those that are <strong>abiotic</strong> (non-biological) and those that are <strong>biotic</strong> (biological). Abiotic factors include but are not limited to the following…</p>
<p><strong>Temperature</strong><br>
The optimum temperature for coral reefs is 23 to 29 degrees Celsius. If the temperature is too high or too low photosynthesis and other metabolic processes important for coral and other organisms are inhibited. Corals generally cannot tolerate temperatures below 18 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p><strong>Sunlight</strong><br>
Lots of sunlight is needed for maximum photosynthesis for corals and other organisms. Additionally, many reef organisms depend on vision to find food and other resources and to signal to one another. However, organisms in shallow waters may face the risk of stress caused by too much ultraviolet light from the sun.</p>

  <p><strong>pH</strong><br>
pH (or ‘acidity’) is actually a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions. It is measured on a scale of 1-14 with 1 being highly acidic, 7 being neutral and 14 being highly alkaline. The ocean is slightly alkaline due to a presence of dissolved carbonate and bicarbonate. The optimum pH for coral reefs is 7.7 – 8.4.</p>

  <p><strong>Sedimentation and Turbidity</strong><br>
‘Turbidity’ refers to the amount of suspended particles in the water column. This will mostly be in the form of stirred up sediment. River run-off, weather disturbance and land disturbance all tend to increase sedimentation. High sedimentation reduces sunlight, which affects the depth at which photosynthetic organisms can thrive. It can also smother the feeding appendages of corals and other organisms that rely on catching small bits of food from the water. Mangroves and seagrass beds are very important for locking in the sediment so that it stabilizes on the benthos and is not so easily swooshed about.</p>

  <p><strong>Salinity</strong><br>
Salinity (aka ‘saltiness’) in the ocean is caused by rock erosion from the land, as well as hydrothermal and volcanic activity. The average ocean salinity is 35ppt (parts per thousand). Suitable salinity is important for optimum calcification rate of growing corals. Freshwater flooding can be a threat to salinity.</p>

  <p><strong>Aragonite Saturation</strong><br>
    Aragonite is a form of dissolved calcium carbonate in the water. Corals and many other organisms absorb it and use it to build their hard skeleton. High concentrations of aragonite can allow for faster growth rate and increased health of these organisms.</p>
  <p><strong>Hydrodynamics</strong><br>
Here, we are referring to the forces that cause water movement around coral reefs.<ul>
<li>Waves – Important for inducing the mixing of nutrients. If waves are strong they can also cause mechanical damage to fragile organisms. Hence, areas of high wave action favour more endurable species, such as corals with flat growth forms, or soft corals and other flexible organisms.</li>
<li>Currents – Help the flow of nutrients. Often the areas of highest growth on the reef are areas most exposed to currents. They also have an effect on temperature distribution. Warm water may be carried from areas of high sun exposure, but upwellings may also bring up cold water from the deep. In areas of strong currents, swimming organisms may have to expend more energy on swimming against the current.</li>
<li>Tides – Tides are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon (and to some extent the sun). Tidal ranges (i.e. the distance between the shoreline at high tide and low tide) vary on different coast lines and in different parts of the world. The Caribbean has very small tidal ranges. In the Indo-Pacific, tidal ranges get much bigger. This means that reef organisms here need to adapt to these large fluctuations which in turn affect exposure to sunlight and other factors.</li>

  <br>
  
<p>Reef characteristics differ at different parts of the reef. For example… 
<ul>
<li>In the shallows, fish are more likely to be small and abundant. At greater depths, they tend to be fewer in numbers but bigger in size.</li>
<li>Green algae will only be found in the shallow or (particularly well-lit) parts of the benthos because it absorbs red light and this does not penetrate water as far as other light waves. Beyond a certain depth, red and brown algae will dominate.</li>
</ul>
If you have a good understanding of the local organisms, you can look for clues about the conditions, depending on what’s growing where. For example…
<ul>
<li>A particularly high domination of foliose coral may indicate that the area receives lots of sediment, making it hard for other coral growth forms to compete.</li> 
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Types of Relationships on the Reef</h2>
<p><strong>Predation</strong><br>
Refers to the act of feeding on other organisms. Herbivores predate on plants (including algae). Carnivores predate on the carnivores. A healthy reef has many carnivores. Their activity is important for several reasons.
<ul>
<li>They control the balance of populations of species. This reduces the chance of one species from dominating over others.</li>
<li>They also help to reduce the spread of diseases and genetic weakness as they are more likely to pick off the disease and the weak.</li> 
<li>They drive predator avoidance behaviour in other organisms. This leads to the spread of wildlife across habitats. For example many reef fish move into seagrass beds or mangrove swamps when the tide makes it possible as these areas are less accessible for large predators. This can benefit these ecosystems as it brings a source of nutrients to them.</li></ul></p>

<p><strong>Competition</strong><br>
Competition happens when two or more organisms require the same resource. Competition may be <strong>interspecific</strong> (between different species) or <strong>intraspecific</strong> (between members of the same species). Examples of resources that are competed over include food, space, sunlight or a potential mate.</p>

<p><strong>Parasitism</strong><br>
Parasitism is an interaction where one species feeds on another whilst keeping it alive. On reefs many tiny crustaceans (such as juvenile isopods) and flatworms parasitize fish, whereby they feed on the blood and tissue. This reduces the health of the fish and increases the chance of them contracting diseases.</p>

<p><strong>Mutualism</strong><br>
Mutualism is an interaction between two species where both species benefit. <strong>Symbiosis</strong> is a relationship where there is persistent contact between the organisms where both species stay alive and at least one species benefits. A symbiosis may or may not be a mutualism. 
<ul>
<li>Coral and has a symbiotic mutualism with zooxanthellae whereby the coral obtain nutrients derived from photosynthesis of the zooxanthellae. The zooxanthellae are protected on the coral as they are less likely to be eaten than if they lived freely in the water column. They also make use of waste products from the metabolic activity of the coral such as ammonium.</li>
<li>There are many cleaning interactions on the reef, whereby one organism (the cleaner) eats parasites or unwanted tissue of another organism. This provides the cleaner with a meal and keeps the health of the other organism in check. Many small fish and shrimp act as cleaners on coral reefs.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Commensalism</strong><br>
Commensalism is a relationship where one species benefits and the other species is neither helped nor hindered by the relationship. One example on the reef is the remora fish which often latches onto bigger fish or marine mammals for an easy ride. This way they can travel a long way towards sources of food without expending much energy.</p>
